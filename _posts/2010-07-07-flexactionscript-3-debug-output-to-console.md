I recently started messing around with the [Flixel][] framework - something built on top of [Flex][] to make retro games. One of the first things I noticed was how difficult it is to debug things - especially complex objects.

The first problem is capturing _any_ debug output. For whatever reason, I was unable to output traces to anywhere useful.
My first success was with using [De MonsterDebugger][] to capture the output. While this was better than nothing, I needed very little of the functionality of De MonsterDebugger and it still didn't give me what I really wanted: formatted console output.

print_r style output in actionscript
-----------------------------

I found a good starting point [here][base86], but the output of this wasn't exactly what I wanted. I messed around with it until I got something more familiar to me.

    package learning {
      import org.flixel.*;
    
      public class Debugger {
        public static function pr(obj:*, level:int = 0, output:String = ""):* {
          var objtype:String = typeof(obj);
          if (objtype == "boolean" || objtype == "string" || objtype == "number") {
            return obj;
          }
    
          var tabs:String = "";
          for(var i:int = 0; i < level; i++) { 
            tabs += "\t"
          }
         
          output += "{\n";
          for(var child:* in obj) {
            output += tabs +"\t["+ child +"] => ";
           
            var childOutput:String = pr(obj[child], level+1);
            if(childOutput != '') output += childOutput
           
            output += "\n";
          }
          output += tabs + "}\n";
         
          return output;
        }
    
        public static function log(obj:*):void {
          FlxG.log(pr(obj));
          // This is a flixel thing. If you're not using flixel
          // Just use trace(pr(obj));
        }
      }
    }

Example output 

    {
    	[0] => {
    		[tile] => 4
    		[rule] => {
    			[0] => xxx
    			[1] => x1x
    			[2] => x1x
    		}
    	}
    	[1] => {
    		[tile] => 8
    		[rule] => {
    			[0] => x1x
    			[1] => x1x
    			[2] => xxx
    		}
    	}
    }

**NOTE**: The colored output is from [Prettify][], not the script

trace output to console
--------------------

This, fortunately, was much less of a hassle for me to get working.

Reference: [Configuring the debugger version of Flash Player][Flex 3 Reference]

**Step 1**

Locate/create your `mm.cfg` file. For me this was in `~/mm.cfg`. See [reference][Flex 3 Reference].

Stick this in it: `TraceOutputFileEnable=1`

Or, in one command: `echo "TraceOutputFileEnable=1" > ~/mm.cfg`

**Step 2**

Locate the location of the log file. Mine is in 

 `~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/Logs/flashlog.txt`

See [reference][Flex 3 Reference].

You don't want to type this in every time you want to view the log, so add a function to your `.bash_profile`

This is what I have:

    flashlog() { 
      tail -f $* ~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash\ Player/Logs/flashlog.txt; 
    }

**Step 3**

Start debugging!

    			[2] => x1x
    		}
    	}
    	[1] => {
    		[tile] => 8
    		[rule] => {
