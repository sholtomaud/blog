title: A Technological Guide to Eurotripping
type: post
url: /2013/11/28/technological-guide-to-eurotripping/
---

I just returned from a two and half month tour of Western Europe to 17 cities in 
11 countries. While the sheer volume of information available at our fingertips 
may [ruin the fear of the unknown][globeandmail], it sure does make jumping from 
country to country a breeze.

Perhaps in the future I'll collect my thoughts enough to write a heartfelt post 
about how exactly traveling changed me, but for now I'll try to provide some 
utility to you in the form of a list of useful tools. I am not sponsored or 
otherwise affiliated with any of the tools I'm listing here.

# [MapsWithMe][] - Offline Maps
*$4.99 -- iOS, Android*

<img src="/images/13-11-28/mapswithme.png" title="MapsWithMe" class="inline" />

MapsWithMe provides offline street maps for the entire world. You download a 
country or region at a time, and it acts roughly like Google Maps minus the 
mobile data requirement. It doesn't have route mapping, but it does have search.  
An often forgotten feature of smartphones is that the GPS does not rely on 
mobile data, and neither does the compass. This means that you can tell where 
you are and where you're pointing on this offline map with no cell connection at 
all!

If you buy the pro version for $4.99, you can download maps for as many regions 
as you'd like. Well worth the price tag.

I have an abysmal sense of direction, often not remembering which way I came 
from when I leave a restaurant, so this was crucial to me being able to find my 
hostel and avoiding sleeping in a ditch. MapsWithMe makes this easy by letting 
you drop pins at points of interest in a variety of colours. Nearer the end of 
the trip, I would've been pretty comfortable just asking local after local for 
directions, but it's definitely handy at night on deserted streets.

MapWithMe was shown to me by my travel buddy [Owen Wang][].

# [Hipmunk][] - Flight Search
*Free (no brokerage fees) -- Web, iOS, Android*

![Hipmunk](/images/13-11-28/hipmunk.png)

There are tons of flight search services now, but I keep coming back to Hipmunk 
for its clean user interface and ability to search for a range of 
departure/arrival dates (e.g. departing between December 2nd and 4th) in order 
to choose the cheapest option. In terms of the interface, I love the way it 
shows you the timing of different options and prominently displays flight 
durations. For speed, I always end up using the web interface over the mobile 
option. They have hotel search too, though I've never used it.

The most interesting alternative I've seen is [Skyscanner][], which lets you 
search for flights from/to a giant region. If you're feeling particularly 
adventurous, you can search for flights leaving from a city and going 
*anywhere*. [Kayak Explore][] provides similar anywhere-but-here search 
functionality.

![Skyscanner](/images/13-11-28/skyscanner.png)

Another thing to be aware of if you're trying to fly on the cheap is [easyJet's 
Route Map][easyjet]. easyJet is one of the cheapest airline you're going to find 
(provided you have only one carry-on bag), so if you can plan your trip around 
the route map, you might save a ton of money. In practice, this probably means 
going to a major travel hub for every second stop. For instance, you can take 
easyJet Berlin &harr; London &harr; Prague, but not Berlin &harr; Prague, so you 
probably don't want to start in London.

# [Hostels.com][hostels.com] - Hostel Search
*Free (with registration) -- Web (Hostelworld for iOS, Android)*

![Hostels.com](/images/13-11-28/hostels.com.png)

A bunch of the hostel search sites have the same inventory now, because they're 
all owned by Hostelworld. I opt for [hostels.com][] instead of 
[hostelworld.com][] for a nicer user interface. It's worth making an account to 
avoid the booking fees. If you want to book on mobile, you'll need to use the 
hostelworld app, which is admittedly pretty crummy but gets the job done when 
you're in a jam.

# [Airbnb][] - Short-term Room and Apartment Rentals
*Free (no subscription) -- Web, iOS, Android*

![Airbnb](/images/13-11-28/airbnb.png)

If you're getting sick of hostels and want a room or whole apartment of your 
own, Airbnb can be pretty handy. I used it to get places in Amsterdam, Lyon, and 
Madrid. It requires a lot more coordination with the owner than just booking a 
hostel room, so avoid leaving this to the last minute.

# [TripAdvisor][] - Restaurant and Attraction Search
*Free -- Web, iOS, Android*

![TripAdvisor](/images/13-11-28/tripadvisor.png)

Even if you're like me and most art museums are not a thrill-filled day-long 
activity, TripAdvisor has a lot of interesting local attractions you might not 
think to look for.  For instance, I found the puzzle game [TRAP Berlin][trap] 
and the surreal industrialist museum [Design Panoptikum][surreal] through 
TripAdvisor.

It can also be handy for finding good restaurants on your phone when you've got 
WiFi.

# [TripIt][] - Itinerary Management
*Free ($49/year for Pro) -- Web, iOs, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone 7*

<img src="/images/13-11-28/tripit.png" title="TripIt" class="inline" />

If you forward all of your itinerary confirmation emails to TripIt, it will 
parse them, aggregate them, and let you share them. This can be really useful 
for letting your family know where you are, or sharing the itinerary with other 
people in your travel party.

If you shell out the $49/year for [TripIt Pro][] (30 day free trial), then you 
get alerts on your phone every time your flight gets a cancellation or gate 
change. It also comes with partnership perks like a Hertz Gold Card (Car 
Rentals) a Regus Businessworld Preferred Membership (see below).

# [Regus][] - Business Lounges
*$49/month for Gold Card, Free with TripIt Pro*

![Regus](/images/13-11-28/regus.png)

Regus is a system of internationally distributed offices. It was useful for me 
to have a space to set up my laptop with decent WiFi to code for a while.  If 
you get a gold card with them, you get access to all of their business lounges, 
which is more or less just a little desk with an outlet in a swanky office 
(usually with a sweet view). The three offices I went to all had free coffee, 
tea, and hot chocolate too.

# [BlaBlaCar][] - Ridesharing
*Free (?) - Web, iOS, Android*

![BlaBlaCar](/images/13-11-28/blablacar.png)

If you're looking for the absolute cheapest way of traveling short of 
hitchhiking, BlaBlaCar is probably the way to go. Berlin &rarr; Prague for 16 
Euros, Paris &rarr; Barcelona for 60. While I didn't actually use this service, 
I met a few people who swore by it.

<hr>

Though this post is about the technology I used, I'd like to emphasize that 
traveling has been about people for me. The [article linked at the top of this 
post][globeandmail] may be right about technology driving a divide between 
travelers and locals, but I did have the amazing opportunity to talk to 
travelers from around the world. I met a Brazilian in Barcelona, a Singaporean 
in Edinburgh, some Brits in Copenhagen, Germans on a train en route to 
Amsterdam, and far too many Australians to count.

Seriously, see how long you can go traveling without meeting an Australian. I 
give you two days, tops.
