title: What I did at Khan Academy
url: /2012/08/22/what-i-did-at-khan-academy/
---

For the past four months, I've been working with the incredible team at Khan 
Academy to get [Khan Academy Computer Science][1] shipped and (mostly) stable. 
In that time. I've been working remotely from Toronto, which has been an 
interesting experience, but that's the topic of a future post.

I'm just going to use this post as a massive braindump for everything I worked 
on so I can share some knowledge, give some examples of the breadth and depth 
that interns at Khan Academy have the opportunity to work at, and so that I can 
remember where all the time went. I also spent a large amount of time 
refactoring everything I wrote and doing code reviews, but that's not much fun 
to [brag about][1].

This is going to be a long one, so feel free to scroll until something catches 
your eye.

{:toc}

Computer Science
================

My primary focus of the term was the new Computer Science curriculum. [John 
Resig][2] had been working on it for a long time before I arrived, but he needed 
a couple extra pairs of hands and eyes to get it shipped. As one of three 
developers working on Computer Science, I ended up being all over the place, but 
here are some of the features I had ownership over.

Backend
-------
![Flask, Jinja2 and GAE logos](/images/12-08-22/flask-jinja2-gae.png)

I've been responsible for creating and modifying the python backend for Computer 
Science since the beginning of my internship. We're using [Google App 
Engine][3]'s [`db.Model`][4] for all the models (one day to be 
[`ndb.Model`][5]), [webapp2][6] for routing all the pages, [Flask][7] for the 
API, and [Jinja2][8] for the server-side templates.

The webapp2 handlers generally only serve HTML, possibly with some model data 
bootstrapped into the page. All of the creating, updating and deleting is done 
via the API from the client-side.

I also wrote a whole bunch of functional and access tests for the API.  
(Functional tests answering the question "Can I do what I'm supposed to?" and 
access tests answering the question "Am I restricted from doing what I'm not 
allowed to?").

Number Scrubber
---------------
![Number Scrubber](/images/12-08-22/number-scrubber.png)

The mechanism for messing around with numbers in the editor was originally just 
a [jQuery UI slider][9]. The slider felt wrong because it had a hard minimum and 
maximum cap despite there being no logical general minimum or maximum for 
numbers in code.

What I really wanted was something closer to to the scrubber described by Bret 
Victor in his [Scrubbing Calculator][10] (the first demo).

The original version of the scrubber that replaced the slider used the x-axis to 
control the base value and the y-axis to control the power of ten used as a 
multiplier. Each horizontal "band" of 50 pixels represented a different power of 
ten.

![2-axis scrubber](/images/12-08-22/2-axis.png)

So if you wanted to increase or decrease at an interval of 100, you would drag 
left and right within the band 75 to 125 pixels above the number. If you wanted 
to increase/decrease at an interval of 0.1, you would drag left and right 25 in 
the band to 75 pixels below the number. Of course, you didn't need to know the 
exact pixel numbers -- you would just move your mouse up and down until it did 
what you wanted. It worked something like the image above.

While in theory this was extremely flexible and beautiful, in testing it out 
with kids at the [Discovery Lab][11], it was apparent that it was confusing and 
not intuitive, so it was scrapped. Right now, the interval the scrubber runs on 
is always 1.

I have a diff awaiting review that restores some of the usefulness in (what I 
hope is) a more intuitive way. Instead of controlling the magnitude by the 
position of the mouse while dragging, the magnitude is controlled by the number 
of decimal places in the original number. The table below summarizes how that 
works.

     number  | interval
    ---------+----------
        0.01 |     0.01
        0.91 |     0.01
        1.01 |     0.01
        0.90 |     0.01
        1.0  |     0.1
        1    |     1
     1000    |     1
     1000.0  |     0.1
       -1.01 |     0.01

Canvas Screenshots
------------------
Since one of the main points of the new Computer Science curriculum was that 
pictures are more engaging and motivating than text, it seemed really silly that 
our list of tutorials was a big wall of text. To fix that, we wanted to have 
every program display with a thumbnail of what the canvas looked like when you 
hit "Save".

The basics of this turned out to be relatively straightforward. The canvas API 
exposes a method [`toDataURL`][12], which I use like so:

```javascript
var imgDataUrl = myCanvas.toDataURL('image/png');
```

This returns a base-64 encoded `data:` URL containing a png. It might look 
something like this:

    data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgA...

In the initial version of this, I just took that `data:image/png` URL and 
crammed it directly into the image `src` of the page, which worked! There were 
two major disadvantages to this approach though: the base-64 encoded version of 
binary data is significantly larger than the original binary data, and no 
caching.

To solve both of these problems, I decoded the base-64 data on demand into a 
png, then set up caching headers to make Google App Engine's Edge Caching 
servers cache the data as long as possible. The python code to do that inside a 
webapp2 handler looks like this:

```python
base64_image_data = image_url[len("data:image/png;base64,"):]

self.response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'image/png'

self.response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'public, max-age=1000000'
self.response.headers['Pragma'] = 'Public'

self.response.out.write(base64.b64decode(base64_image_data))
```

It turns out the headers that make Edge Caching kick in need to be pretty 
specific. You can read more about them here:
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/google-appengine/6xAV2Q5x8AU/QI26C0ofvhwJ>

Content
-------
My very, very first task was actually to create some proof of concept content 
using the editor to mimic some of [Vi Hart's Doodles][13]. These were a lot of 
fun to work on, and they didn't take very long. You can see all the ones I 
created to meet that end in [Programs tagged with Vi Hart][14]. Many of them 
have since been made much more aesthetically pleasing by fellow intern [Jessica 
Liu][15], who voices all the tutorials at the moment.

![my programs](/images/12-08-22/programs.png)

From left to right, top to bottom, these are a bunch of the programs I wrote 
that show up on under [All Programs][32] on Khan Academy.

* [Playing with Sin and Cos](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/playing-with-sin-and-cos/938892965)
* [Spinning Galaxy](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/spinning-galaxy/846913979)
* [Circle Splitter](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/circle-splitter/938934557)
* [Star Creator](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/star-creator/823072130)
* [Super Spiral](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/super-spiral/823021393)
* [Maze Generator](https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/maze-generator/939110892)

Production Import
-----------------
![prod_import.py](/images/12-08-22/prod-import.png)

In an effort to provide adequate test data when working locally, I wrote a 
script to import all of the official Khan Academy programs to my local 
environment to make sure everything is working alright. This works by hitting an 
API handler on the production server, parsing the data, and inserting a bunch of 
records into the local datastore.

I wanted to make it so that I could import regularly without manually having to 
clean up the last import first, but I didn't want to add a property to every 
single program record in production. Instead, I generate a user to own all of 
the programs imported from production, then simply delete all programs owned by 
that user in the script before the next import is performed. This lets me run 
the script and know that I have the latest copy of things on production without 
having duplicates.

Discussions
-----------
![Discussions](/images/12-08-22/discussions.png)

The last major feature I worked on before launch was getting discussions running 
on programs. The discussions system was originally designed to only work for 
videos, so this was a messy endeavour. With some vim-fu, I got this hammered out 
in 3 days, then spent the next 2 days fixing bugs found in production.

The crux of the problem was replacing every instance of "video" in the 
discussions code with a polymorphic abstraction which I called the discussion 
"focus" that could refer to either a video or a program. I initially just made 
it so that "focus" was either a `Video` instance or a `Scratchpad` instance 
(`Scratchpad` is the internal name for programs, since they underwent several 
name changes in the UI, from "Scratchpad" to "Exploration" to "CodeCanvas", 
finally ending up as "Program").

I shipped this change, but it quickly became apparent that this was hideously 
fragile and resulted in duck typing of the worst kind. If someone was trying to 
change something with the discussions on videos and forgot about programs during 
their testing, there was likely to be a failure outside of what they were 
testing. These problems are really difficult to catch in automated testing too, 
because the error might happen on the clientside, when some data that's assumed 
to be there is just not in the JSON passed down at all, so it'll fail silently 
as `undefined`.

To fix this problem, I wrapped the model acting as the "focus" with an 
intermediate layer with a strict interface. To do this, I created an abstract 
class using python's built-in library [abc][16] and made a class which 
subclasses `abc.AbstractBaseClass`. This way, if someone wants to add some 
functionality for videos, it will be extremely apparent to them that there are 
other places that need updating. Because of the nature of `abc`, it'll also 
likely result in unit test failures instead of silent failures, since any 
subclass of `DiscussionFocus` that doesn't fully implement the interface will 
throw an exception upon instantiation.

Khan Academy Tools and Infrastructure
=====================================

Outside of the Computer Science stuff, I put in a couple of features and fixes 
for internal tooling and infrastructure.

Devshell
--------
![devshell](/images/12-08-22/devshell.png)

One of the gripes I've had with most of the web frameworks I've used since 
building in Rails at [The Working Group][17] is how comparatively crummy the 
developer tools are. One of the things I missed most was `rails console`. It 
spins up a ruby REPL with the entire environment already loaded. This means I 
can access models in the DB and make requests as if they were hitting a server.  
This was an indispensable tool for testing and debugging.

To my delight, one of my coworkers, [Desmond Brand][18], had already written 
such a tool to use with Google App Engine. Near the beginning of the term, our 
entire system was upgraded from Python 2.5 to 2.7, which meant we could use 
[IPython][19].

I took the idea behind what Desmond had written and rewrote it to use IPython 
instead, resulting in a development REPL that would give me real DB access. I 
called it `devshell.py`. Eventually, I was even able to make it work with 
production data, allowing us to do similar things to the remote console on 
Heroku.

Unfortunately, the system that powers `devshell.py` is too entangled in our 
codebase at the moment to make open sourcing it simple, but here are the basic 
steps that you need to go through:

1. Programmatically find the path to the GAE SDK, and add that to `sys.path`.  
   This will allow you to import things from the `google` namespace in the REPL.

```python
def _discover_sdk_path():
    """Return directory from $PATH where the Google Appengine DSK lives."""
    # adapted from {http://code.google.com/p/bcannon/source/browse/
    # sites/py3ksupport-hrd/run_tests.py}

    # Poor-man's `which` command.
    for path in os.environ['PATH'].split(':'):
        if os.path.isdir(path) and 'dev_appserver.py' in os.listdir(path):
            break
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("couldn't find appcfg.py on $PATH")

    # Find out where App Engine lives so we can import it.
    app_engine_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(path), 'google_appengine')
    if not os.path.isdir(app_engine_path):
        raise RuntimeError('%s is not a directory' % app_engine_path)
    return app_engine_path

sys.path.append(_discover_sdk_path())
```

2. Programmatically find the root of your GAE project, and add THAT to 
   `sys.path`. This will let you import your models to play around with.

```python
def _project_rootdir():
    appengine_root = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    while True:  # do while loop
        if os.path.exists(os.path.join(appengine_root, 'app.yaml')):
            return appengine_root

        old_appengine_root = appengine_root
        appengine_root = os.path.dirname(appengine_root)

        if appengine_root == old_appengine_root:
            # we're at and haven't found app.yaml
            raise IOError('Unable to find app.yaml above cwd: %s'
                        % os.path.dirname(__file__))

sys.path.append(_project_rootdir())
```

3. Get datastore access using [`remote_api_stub.ConfigureRemoteApi`][20]. This 
   is what will let you fetch and mutate models in the datastore in the REPL.  
   This requires that you have a running `dev_appserver.py`.

```python
from google.appengine.ext.remote_api import remote_api_stub

remote_api_stub.ConfigureRemoteApi(
    None,
    '/_ah/remote_api',
    auth_func=lambda: ('test', 'test')
    servername="localhost:8080")
    ```

4. Embed IPython.

```python
import IPython
IPython.embed()
```

Once all that's done, you *hopefully* have a working IPython REPL for local 
development. Enjoy!

XSS Fix
-------
All over the site, we have JSON embedded into the site used to bootstrap data 
into pages so they don't have to immediately fire an AJAX request before being 
able to display anything. This is a really common strategy, but it's 
unfortunately subject to a frustrating XSS vulnerability.

While we of course escape any user input in templates before we render them, 
usually having raw HTML strings in JSON is fine, and sometimes useful. When 
we're rendering user content in client-side template with [Handlebars][21], the 
output is escaped anyway. So we're safe, right? Wrong.

The *one* case where HTML strings in embedded JSON cause problems is when they 
contain `</script>`. Here's an example of a template that's vulnerable to this 
problem.

```html
<script>
    var page = {{json.dumps(page)}};
</script>
```

Normally, something like `{"body": "<h1>Awesome Page</h1>"}` gets passed in, and 
we have no problem. We get this as a result:

```html
<script>
    var page = {"body": "<h1>Awesome Page</h1>"};
</script>
```

And this is totally fine -- no security problem. The problem comes around when 
you inject `</script>` because it ends the script immediately, even though it 
might be in the middle of a string. So if 

```javascript
{"body": "</script><script>alert('pwned - greetz to KA');</script>"}
```

gets sent to the template, the resulting page will have an alert on it. But 
WAIT, you might say, why not just escape any HTML that gets put into the JSON 
dump? Because then it's subject to double escaping, and nobody wants to see 
`&lt;` on the page. Instead, to fix this, I patched the JSON encoder we use (we 
don't use `json.dumps` directly for other reasons) to replace every occurrence 
of `</` with `<\/`. Which seems to fix the problem, since `<\/script>` won't 
break in the middle of script tags. This doesn't disrupt existing behaviour, 
because `'/'` and `'\/'` are identical in JavaScript.

Blog Posts
==========

Here's a conversation I had with [Ben Kamens][22], Khan Academy's lead 
developer, near the beginning of my internship.

    Me: hey - what's the policy on blogging during work hours? (I'm a lot more 
    aware of "work hours" now that I'm clocking my working hours)

    Him: encouraged
    Him: assuming it's remotely relevant :)

    Me: cool :P

    Him: if it's a blog about ice cream sandwiches, then it's only encouraged 
    for 4 hours a day instead of 8

As a result, I got to take the time to write a bunch of blog posts I never 
would've had the time to write during my free time (including this one!).

* [An Argument for Mutable Local History][23] in which I argue for amending and 
  rebasing and generally whine about merge commits.
* [My Mercurial Setup and Workflow at Khan Academy][24] in which I describe in 
  rambling detail how I get code into the repository.
* [Khan Academy Computer Science: Instant Gratification and Bragging Rights][25] 
  in which I explain how my love of stacking plastic bricks led me to help 
  create Khan Academy's Computer Science platform.

In general, I try to write at least one blog post a month, but I've been missing 
that goal a lot during previous work terms and during school. This post makes 4 
posts in 4 months, which hasn't happened in a while.

Open Source
===========

I also had the opportunity to contribute to a fairly sizable open source project 
and release two small ones of my own.

arcanist
--------
[Arcanist][28] is the commandline component of [Phabricator][26], which Khan 
Academy partially adopted at the beginning of my internship as a new code review 
tool. I had used it extensively while I was working at Facebook during a 
previous internship, and I found the mercurial support lacking.

So I opened my vim, hacked away, then hopped on IRC in #phabricator and got my 
pull requests on github merged (Evan Priestley is amazing). My main contribution 
is supporting a mutable history workflow for mercurial that was previously only 
available in git. This should eventually lead to near parity with Phabricator's 
git support.  The only major component still missing is the ability to use `arc 
land`.

You can see my contributions to the project on github: [jlfwong's commits on 
facebook/arcanist][27].

vim-arcanist
------------
[vim-arcanist on GitHub][29]

I `<3` vim and I `<3` the functionality introduced in `arc inlines`, so I 
thought I'd try my hand at writing a vim plugin to combine them.

`arc inlines` lists all of the inline comments for the current associated 
Differential revision.

`:ArcInlines` takes that list and shoves it into the quickfix buffer for quick 
navigation with `:cnext` and `:cprev`.

The result looks something like this:

![vim-arcanist](/images/12-08-22/vim-arcanist.png)

There's more information in the README in [vim-arcanist on GitHub][29].

This was my first reasonably polished vim plugin, but more importantly, this is 
the first project I've tried to promote and document with pictures and a 
screencast. I learned that screencasting can be a frustrating endeavour and that 
making GIFs is time consuming.

vim-mercenary
-------------
[vim-mercenary on Github][30]

![vim-mercenary Blame](/images/12-08-22/vim-mercenary.png)

vim-mercenary is a mercurial wrapper for vim that allows you to make some 
mercurial commands more useful by augmenting them with vim's capabilities. The 
image above shows `:HGblame`, which annotates the current file with the blame
and locks the scrolling of the two windows together.

There are more screenshots and a bunch of documentation in the README in 
[vim-mercenary on GitHub][30].

The plugin was heavily inspired by Tim Pope's git wrapper for vim, 
[vim-fugitive][31]. Originally, I was hoping to just hack vim-fugitive to 
repurpose it for mercurial, but eventually discovered that the architectures of 
hg and git are too different for it to be feasible. I did spend a lot of time 
reading through the source of vim-fugitive for inspiration on how to tackle the 
problem though.

The result is a fairly limited feature set, taking only the parts I found most 
useful and easiest to implement from vim-fugitive and sticking them into 
vim-mercenary.
