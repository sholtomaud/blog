I finally got back around to updating Omegle Voyeur with the ability to 
interfere, and decided to re-implement the whole thing in jQuery while I'm at 
it. Since jQuery doesn't come with a built-in method of building classes, I used 
<a href="http://www.danwebb.net/2008/1/31/low-pro-for-jquery">lowpro for 
jQuery</a>. It's a port of a class building scheme from Prototype. It doesn't do 
everything I could have hoped for, but it served most of my needs.

The other thing I implemented was a way of knowing when Omegle is blocking 
requests. They have a more robust form of detection now - it isn't just manual 
IP ban. Once you request too many things from them too fast, they start 
requesting a captcha. Locally, this isn't a problem - I simply embed an iframe 
with Omegle in it and provide instructions to the user. Hosted, this is a more 
troublesome problem, since the captcha is directed towards an IP, so it must be 
responded to from that IP. I have no solution to this problem at the moment, but 
I'm going to look into implementing the whole thing using Greasemonkey so this 
isn't an issue at all.

For now, you can see the latest version here: <a

Don't be surprised if it's down, and please go grab your own copy: <a

Now on to the customary technical concept to go along with my own self promotion.

<h1>AJAX Method Callbacks</h1>
 While passing functions as arguments is a pretty standard thing among almost 
 all languages, attempting to pass methods of specific instances as arguments in 
 JavaScript presents an interesting problem. Consider the following:

```js
function car(price) {
    this.price = price;

    this.setPrice = function(price) {
        this.price = price;
    };
}

function pass666(func) {
    func(666);
}

var redcar = new car(2000);
alert(redcar.price);
redcar.setPrice(123);
alert(redcar.price);
pass666(redcar.setPrice);
alert(redcar.price);
```

As you might expect, the first two alerts will say 2000 and 123 respectively. 
But the last one also says 123. Why?

It all has to do with what `this` refers to. Both in the initialization of 
`redcar` and the modifier call `redcar.setPrice`, "this" refers to the instance 
of the function car given the identifier name `redcar`. In the `pass666` 
version, `this` refers to the function `pass666`. As a result, it does nothing 
to modify the properties of the car because it isn't told anything about 
`redcar`.

One way to fix this is to use a placeholder variable. I used "self". Change the 
definition of car to the following yields the desired result.

```js
function car(price) {
    this.price = price;

    var self = this;
    this.setPrice = function(price) {
        self.price = price;
    };
}
```

In this example, it's difficult to see why you would ever want to use this in 
the first place. The reason I encountered this problem is my need to use 
instance methods as callback functions for AJAX calls. Here's an excerpt of the 
jQuery version of Omegle Voyeur to see what I'm talking about.

```js
sendQuery: function(target,respFunc) {
  // Send a query to the omegle server
  var self = this;
  if (respFunc == null) {
    respFunc = function(self,data) {}
  }
  $.ajax({
    url: 'omegle.php?'+target,
    type: 'GET',
    dataType: 'json',
    success: function(data) {
      respFunc(self,data);
    }
  });
},
```

Sending a request to the Omegle server is a very common task in Omegle Voyeur, 
so I wanted all the AJAX requests leaving from the same method. This means I 
have to accept the callback function as a parameter. I've written all the 
callback methods to accept a parameter `self` which will refer to the instance 
of interest.

This aspect is one of the many things that makes Prototype's class system 
superior to jQuery's. However, since jQuery makes a lot of other things nicer 
and the two libraries don't play together very well, I decided to port over to 
jQuery nonetheless. In Prototype, there's a function called <a 
href="http://www.prototypejs.org/api/function/bind">bind</a> (not to be confused 
with <a href="http://api.jquery.com/bind/">jQuery's bind</a> which does 
something completely different,) which solves this problem elegantly.

To fix the redcar problem with the aid of Prototype without having to use a 
placeholder variable, you can use bind like so:

```js
function car(price) {
    this.price = price;

    this.setPrice = function(price) {
        this.price = price;
    };
}

function pass666(func) {
    func(666);
}

var redcar = new car(2000);
alert(redcar.price);
redcar.setPrice(123);
alert(redcar.price);

pass666(redcar.setPrice.bind(redcar));

alert(redcar.price);
```

The line `pass666(redcar.setPrice.bind(redcar));` is what makes this work out. 
We're explicitly saying that we want `setPrice` executed from the scope of the 
instance.

If I ever have to hire someone for a web development job, I'll be sure to ask 
something about this.
